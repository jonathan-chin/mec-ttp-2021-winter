# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 9: Now with Validated Forms!


## Purpose

Primarily to practice using Material UI Input elements to create form skeletons in React, within the framing of a mock informational website.

Secondarily to practice implementing form validation in React.

## Task and requirements

Create a **copy** your previous assignment (8 Now with Pages!) as a separate repo. Create at least 2 forms with at least 3 input components each. This can take the shape of a contact form, a newsletter sign up form, a sign up form, etc.

Try to use other input components in addition to `<TextField />` such as `<Checkbox />`, `<Date / Time />`, and `<Slider />`. You can also try using different props of `<TextField />`, such as `select`, `multiline`, `password`, and `required` to generate variety.

Creating forms that meet this requirement will earn you a grade of 2. To receive a 3 or 4 grade, you must implement form validation checks. This can include a minimum length, maximum length, character check, etc.

## Reference Materials

W3 Schools has a quick tutorial on form validation in React. They do not use Material UI but the general idea is the same. You can use this as a general guideline, then extend it to use Material UI components.

Additionally, you have access to the form-validation sample React app in this repo.
