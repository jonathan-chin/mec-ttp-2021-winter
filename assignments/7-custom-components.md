# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 7: Custom Components

## Purpose

To practice creating custom React components and using state and prop variables within the framing of building a mock informational website.

## Task and requirements

Create a **copy** your previous assignment (6 Positive Projection) as a separate repo. For each team member on your team, you must create 2 custom components and include them in the website. You can do accomplish this by adding new parts to your site and/or by rearranging existing parts into separate component files.

Components are often used to keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Another use case for components is to simply things, so you might group together other components under one, even if you aren't using multiple times.
