# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 10: en Espa√±ol

## Purpose

To practice making an API call to a 3rd party in React

## Task

Create a simple React form that sends a piece of text to Google's Translate API. This can be for any language or have a dropdown for the user to specify the language. Display the response to the user in some way.

Because this is relatively complicated, your team is responsible for only one form. However, be sure to be inclusive and let each member observe and/or try building this. After the completion of this assignment, each member on your team should be familiar enough to be able to recreate it on their own.

## Requirements

You need to do some basic form validation. Limit the user's input to something reasonable, like 100 characters. You need to store your Google API key separate from your code and modify your .gitignore file from your repo. **This is important because your repos are public!** **This is important because your repos are public!** **This is important because your repos are public!**.

## Pricing

When setting up your Google API key, you will be required to create a billing account. Google Translate will give you $10 in credit every month to reimburse any calls. For practical terms, this means that the first 500,000 characters you send to translate every month will be free.

This should be just fine for this bootcamp. In your development phase, as you are preparing the assignment for submission, be sure to limit the number of characters you send to Google in your testing.

## SDK

Google has a great Node JS SDK that simplifies things. I highly suggest you use it.
