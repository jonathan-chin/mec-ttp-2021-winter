# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 6: Positive Projection

## Purpose

To practice using the terminal, working with `npm`, writing basic JSX code, and using the Material UI framework within the framing of building a mock informational website.

## Task

With your team, imagine that 10 years have passed and you have formed some sort of tech related company together. It does not have to be in coding, but you all have to be founding members. What is it? Why is it important? How do you operate? What sort of information do you want to present to new visitors to your site?

Take all of this information and produce a simple React website. For now, it will all have to fit on one page since we have not gone over how to produce multiple pages.

## Requirements

Each team member needs to use 3 Material UI components, **not** counting Grid. You can use the same components between team members. For example, if Rachel is writing the section on About Us, she can use Material UI Button, Accordion, and Card. If Elvis is writing the section on History of Impact, he can use Material UI Slider, Snackbar, and Card. They each are using 3 components, even though there is overlap.

The website should use Grid by default and be responsive.

## Reference Materials

Browse through Material UI's list of components first and get a sense of what is available and how they work. You may also dive into the `Component API` list for finer details on how to use things.

## Additive Education

Since React is a large topic stretching over multiple days, we will be reusing your code from this assignment for future assignments. Therefore, make sure you spend time now to agree on something your team will be proud of.

## Submission

Submit a single github link before 11:59pm EST on Jan 12, 2021 using the following form. Only one student on your team needs to submit and be sure to tag all the team members when submitting.
