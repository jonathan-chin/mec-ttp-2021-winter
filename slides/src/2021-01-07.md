# Quick Notes about HW

- Remember to add yourself when submitting!
- No need to resubmit homework. Because you are sending a github link, we can see the most up to date code. If you make changes after submission, it will still be reflected.
- Caveat to that is if you make changes after the deadline, we'll be able to see the commit history and roll back to the last commit before your submission.

# A History of Screen Sizes

Before the widespread adoption of the Internet, physical media (ie books, papers, newspapers) were all of predictable sizes. You could reasonably estimate how much information you could present on a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.

Even in the early days of Internet adoption, people had pretty much all the same setup: boxy CRT monitors with a 1024x768 resolution. It's information density was still fairly predictable.

# Modern Internet Enabled Devices
## Quick Poll: what is your smartphone's manufacturer and model?

# Myriad of Devices

Today, people can access the Internet on a wide variety of devices: laptops, desktops, chromebooks, tablets, and smartphones. They may have a single 4k monitor or have multiple monitors. It is impossible to predict what a user's resolution will be.

Additionally, they may have different capabilities depending on the device. Is it touch screen? Can it flip from landscape to portrait? Can the website / browser be resized?

The solution is Responsive Design.

# Real Example 1/2

This site was built without responsive design in mind. What are some issues you can observe?

**note** You can use your web developer console to simulate different common devices.

# Real Example 2/2

This is a dummy site built to demonstrate the power of responside design. How is this experience different?

# What is Responsive Design?

A design principle that websites (and webapps, hybrid apps, etc) should alter their UI/UX to match individual users' setup (resolution, input devices, screen orientation, etc) to deliver the best possible experience.

This is mainly accomplished through CSS.

# Remember! Cascading Rules

Recall that CSS rules can overwrite each other. An HTML tag may have a dozen different rulesets trying to specify the same property. Depending on the order of rulesets and a few other factors, one property is finally determined.

To achieve responsive design principles, the major browsers implemented widespread support for `media queries` in 2012. `media queries` are a superset of rulesets that apply under certain device environments.

# Media Query Syntax 1/2

```
@media screen and (min-width: 480px){
  img.profile{
    display: none;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 720px){
  h1{
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
```

# Media Query Syntax 2/2

With the right mix of media queries, you can provide the best UI/UX experience for every user regardless of their device environment. Check out the css file for the demo we saw earlier:

# Heavy Lifting

Responsive Design principles are such a ubiquitous need that nearly every web framework has a solution. Instead of writing everything from scratch for each project we have, let's make use of web frameworks, aka libraries. We'll do this by loading an external CSS file via a CDN:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css">`

*This is also the syntax for using an external CSS file instead of embedding a `<style></style>`*

# Quick Tutorial on Materialize 1/2

The CSS framework we'll be using today and for assignment 3 is Materialize. It is a pure CSS implementation of Material UI, a ReactJS framework that we'll be using for our capstone projects. Material Design is a set of principles developed by Google that gives all their products a cohesive, consistent, rich UI/UX experience.

# Quick Tutorial on Materialize 2/2

Materialize heavily relies on CSS classes to give developers a relatively painless way to apply their well calculated CSS rule sets. For us, we will only be focusing on their `grid` system.

Remember how to add class attributes to HTML tags? Type an example into chat!
