# Culminating Week 1
## We now have everything we need to build an awesome website

1. **HTML** provides the building blocks in the form of tags
2. **CSS** gives us powerful transformations to change the look and feel of those tags
3. **JS** allows the user to interact with tags in rich and meaningful way

We'll be using these core principles when we transition to React

# The DOM

The HTML tags we've been writing are converted by your browser to a more programmer friendly representation, known as the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a series of nested objects called nodes, where each node represents a tag and contains variables and functions related to it.

Every node in the DOM is ultimately accessible from every other node; the root node where everything starts is contained in a global variable named `document`. Any changes in the DOM will be automatically, instantly reflected on the webpage.

# Manipulating the DOM with JS

To start working with specific tags in the DOM, we first need a reference to them. The `document` variable gives us a few ways to do that:

- `document.getElementById('banner')`
- `document.getElementsByClassName('cards')`
- `document.getElementsByTagName('p')`
- `document.querySelector('.product_photo .main')`

`document.querySelector('/* CSS Selector */')` is the most powerful selection function since it uses CSS selector syntax. This directly transfers over from the selectors we learned about yesterday.

# Altering the DOM

Once we have a reference to an HTML tag (or collection of tags), we can alter them. DOM nodes contain a variable called `classList` that exposes the several handy functions. The MDN documentation has a concise explanation of them:

# JS Event Listeners

So far, we've been able to reference into the DOM and manipulate existing tags. This provides a one way communication channel `JS => DOM`. What about the other way? Can we trigger JS code from the DOM?

To do so, we use `event listeners`. These don't operate actively but instead trigger a function when something happens on the page, like a click or hover over.

---

# Listening for clicks

The simplest demonstration of this is listening for mouse clicks. All HTML tags can have a `onclick` attribute that executes a JS expression, most commonly a function. Here's what that looks like:

```
// HTML file
<button onclick="send_tweet()">Share on Twitter!</button>

// JS file
function send_tweet(){
  // call Twitter API
}
```

# External CSS and JS files

```
<link rel='stylesheet' href='styles.css' />
<script src='game.js'></script>
```

# Expanding our Toolkit

Since we are using Materialize for its grid system, everything else is open to us as well. Let's take advantage of this and use their prebuilt `components`. *The concept of components is key to ReactJS and we'll be revisiting them in depth next week.*
