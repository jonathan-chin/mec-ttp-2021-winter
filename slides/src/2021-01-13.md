# Review

1. What are prop variables?
2. What are state variables?
3. What does the `render()` function do in React components?
4. What does the `this` keyword do?

# Quick Note

The Material UI API code examples use the hook generator `makeStyles`. The same things (at least for our purposes) can be accomplished with `.css` files and inline styling. For now, when referring to the sample code, you can ignore everything related to styles and classes. The important thing is you need the component before using it.

---

# Advanced React Patterns 1/5

To include external CSS files, all you need to do is import them:

`import './relative/path/to/file'`

Generally, you want to do this somewhere higher up in your app, like index.js or App.js so that you can guarantee it goes loaded.

**Note** we are only able to do this because our React boilerplate includes and configures `webpack`. This illustrative of the power of boilerplate code.

# Advanced React Patterns 2/5

To display images, all you need to do is import them:

`import Logo from '../assets/img/logo.png';`

and pass them into your `img` tag as the `src` property:

`<img src={Logo} />`

---

# Advanced React Patterns 3/5

In JSX, you can store components (including HTML ones) as variables:

`const header_label = <h1>Welcome {this.props.first_name}!</h1>;`

By itself, this doesn't have many advantages over just including it in the `return()` statement inside `render()`. But, it allows you to do the following:

---

# Advanced React Patterns 4/5

Sometimes, you will want a component to perform a **conditional render**, meaning that you want to show 1 thing if a variable evaluates to true and a different thing if it evaluates to false. There are a few ways to do this, but the pattern I've found to make the most sense is this:

```
// this.props.memberType is one of ['student', 'teacher']
return(<>
		<Assignments />
		{this.props.memberType == 'teacher' &&
			<Grades />}
</>);
```

---

# Advanced React Patterns 5/5

You can programmatically generate multiple copies of a component using a `map()` call:

```
let deck = ['2D', '2C', '2H', '2S', /* ... */, 'AS'];
let cards = deck.map((card) => {
	return <Card key={card} value={card[0]}
			suit={card[1]} label={card} />;
});
return(<>
	{cards}
</>);
```

# Remember!

JSX is built **on top** of JS! Anything valid in JS is still valid here. That's why we're able to use the `.map()` function on the array `deck`. Refer back to the MDN and W3 Schools guide for fundamental JS:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# The key Prop

A core feature of React is its rendering speed. Under the hood, it represents the page as an object, so that individual properties can be selected quickly. When converting an array of values to components (as in the deck of cards example), React is actually converting it into an object since it has many performance advantages over arrays. **In order to do this**, you must supply every top level component with a `key` prop that has a unique identifier.

If you don't do this, your JS console will throw a descriptive warning. This is another reason to get into the habit of reading (and understanding) error messages.

---

# Fat Arrow Notation 1/2

Remember the different ways to declare functions in JS? One that we glanced over was the `fat arrow notation` (sometimes called just `arrow notation`). Now that we will be writing fairly complex React applications, it becomes more important to understand the distinctions between the different ways.

The special keyword `this` provides a reference to the current scope. It allows functions within a component to access other functions and variables within the same component, which is incredibly powerful. `this`, however, changes as you nest components and functions together and this may not be desirable.

---

# Fat Arrow Notation 2/2

One way to maintain `this` is to use the fat arrow notation instead of the `function()` notation. There are other ways to maintain the correct scope, but the fat arrow notation is the fastest way to write it.

```
let sum = () => {
	// `this` is the same as the parent's `this`
};
let average = function(){
	// `this` is a brand new scope
}
```

---

# Event handling in React

Previously, we saw how HTML tags can call JS through the onclick attribute:

`<button onclick="send_email()">Send</button>`

JSX has similar notation with one key difference: capitalization.

`<button onClick="send_email()">Send</button>`

**NOTE** you will be switching contexts when calling functions through the `onClick` (and similar) prop. You generally want to keep the context and will need to use the fat arrow notation or similar strategy. The official React guides mention this as well: [https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

# React Router

React is designed to build full scale, production ready websites, which can be pretty complex. For example:

[https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction](https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction)

You'll notice that it behaves like a traditional website, including multiple pages with different urls. But doesn't React build an `SPA`?

---

# What is it? Why is it important?

React Router is an incredibly popular package that allows you to segment your React app. On a browser, this resembles a traditional website; on an app, this represents different views or screens. This is all produced in the context of an SPA, so you still retain the speed and efficiency advantages.

React Router also provides other powerful tools such as route guards (related to authentication, logging in, signing up, etc) and lazy loading (providing even more performance increases).
